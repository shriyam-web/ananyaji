Some people enter your workplace, and suddenly it's not just a place you go to work — it's where you want to be. You are my manager in office, but additionally… you manage my gossip sessions, double-standard jokes, and coffee cravings 😏\n\nWe talk deadlines, but end up discussing lifelines ❤"

Because working with you feels less like reporting, more like reliving college with deadlines. 😂"
